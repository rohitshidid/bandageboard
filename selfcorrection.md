# selfcorrection.md — Preference Ledger

> READ before touching any code. Cumulative memory of user feedback,
> coding preferences, stylistic choices, and past corrections.

## Coding Preferences
- **Team = 3 developers**, not 4. ARCHITECTURE.md drafts a 4-person split — collapse to 3 independent workstreams (data+decision / extraction / dashboard+deploy).
- Plans must let the 3 people work **independently** — anchor on a shared contract (`/lib/types.ts`) + mocks (`/lib/mocks.ts`) so nobody is blocked.

## Stylistic Choices
- Plans should END with: (1) a copy-paste **code-sync prompt** to merge the branches, and (2) explicit **deploy + run steps** (local + production).

## LLM / Anthropic Decisions (Person 2)
- Use the **official `@anthropic-ai/sdk`** with structured outputs (`messages.parse` + `zodOutputFormat`), NOT the Vercel AI SDK that ARCHITECTURE.md first named. (Per claude-api skill: official SDK is the default for Anthropic code.)
- Default extraction model: **`claude-opus-4-8`** (override via `EXTRACT_MODEL`). Don't downgrade to Haiku unless the user asks.
- **De-identify BEFORE any LLM call** — `deidentify()` strips PHI, model sees `[PLACEHOLDER]` tokens only. Hard rule.
- Lazy-load the Anthropic SDK (dynamic `import()` inside the call) so the deterministic path + pure tests don't depend on it at module load.
- LLM is **opt-in** (`EXTRACT_USE_LLM=true`) and degrades to deterministic when no key — never block the pipeline on the model.
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/zod` (`zodOutputFormat`) does NOT exist in `@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.68` — `next build` (webpack) fails to resolve even a dynamic import of it. Use a plain JSON-only prompt + local `zod.safeParse` instead (also more portable). `tsx` won't catch this if the import path is only hit at runtime behind a guard — `npm run build` will.
- When reading Anthropic response content, `resp.content` is a union — narrow with a loop/`"text" in b`, not `.find(...).text` (ThinkingBlock has no `.text`; tsc 400s in build).

## Past Corrections
| # | Date | Correction | Applies To |
|---|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | 2026-06-28 | Re-split the 4-person architecture into a 3-person plan. | plan.md / team structure |
| 2 | 2026-06-28 | Append a sync prompt + deploy/run steps to the plan. | plan.md format |
| 3 | 2026-06-28 | Don't add new files for a small logic fix during parallel group work — edit the existing file directly to minimize merge-conflict surface. | engine.ts / general editing style during active parallel branches |

## Real-Data Facts (verified by ingesting the live API — trust over API.md)
- Active Medicare Part B = `coverage.payer_code === "MCB"` AND `effective_to === null`. `payer_type` is "Medicare" for both Part A and B — useless as discriminator.
- Assessment `raw_json` shape is nested `{sections:[{questions:[{question,answer}]}]}` or a single free-text "Wound narrative" answer. NOT the flat `{wound_type, length_cm,...}` from the docs.
- Notes are prose ("Measures 5.9 x 4.5cm, depth 1.8cm") or Envive narratives, rarely clean SPN labels.

## Threshold Logic Decisions (engine.ts, vs threshold.md)
- threshold.md requires "latest documentation says wound healed/resolved → `reject`" as a hard rule + dangerous-edge-case test. The original engine.ts had zero handling of this — fixed by adding `HEALED_RE`/`ACTIVE_RE` checks in `decide()`, fed by `latestWoundText` (most recently dated note/assessment) computed in `compute.ts`.
- Conflicting healed+active language in the *same* latest doc → `flag_for_review`, never `reject` — matches the team rule "extra flags are acceptable, wrong auto_accept/reject are not."
- This check runs right after the active-MCB confirmation, before the missing-wound branch, so a stale-but-complete wound record from an earlier date can't out-rank a newer "healed" note.

## Do-Not-Repeat List
- Don't plan around 4 people. It's 3.
- Don't mix `patient_id` (string) and integer `id` across API endpoints (project hard rule).
- Don't trust API.md field shapes/values — verify against ingested data first.
- Don't put secrets only in `.env.local` if tsx/drizzle scripts need them — those read `.env` via dotenv. Conversely an empty `.env.local` shadows `.env` in Next. Keep one source: `.env`.
- Don't pin `@next/swc-*` platform binaries as hard deps — breaks cross-platform (Vercel) installs.
- `--limit` in `ingest` = slice size, not a total cap. Use `--once` for a true single-slice smoke test.
